gif-tastic-THE GIFFATHER

For my first foray into the world of APIs, I enjoyed the opportunity to make a pun out of my all time favorite movie series. A funny thing about gifs though. Through this project I learned that even a very specific gif search does not necessarily return the gifs you expect. What you're hoping to find may not even show up in the top 10 responses. For 2.0 of THE GIFFATHER, I would like to see if I can't limit the scope of JSON responses to gifs only from THE GODFATHER.
